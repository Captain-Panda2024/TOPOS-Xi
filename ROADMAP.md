# TOPOS-Xi Development Roadmap (Holonic Code Architect Edition)

## Phase 1 - 6: Foundation to Category Theory (Completed)
- [x] Basic Compiler & StdLib
- [x] Quantum Simulation
- [x] Euler Characteristic Validation
- [x] Recursive Mappings & Scoping
- [x] Pattern Matching & Lambda Mappings
- [x] Category Theory Integration (Morphisms, Orientability)

## Phase 7: Product Spaces & Internal Language (Completed)
- [x] Product Spaces ($X \times Y$) & Projections
- [x] Product Manifold Validation (Euler/Homotopy check)
- [x] Internal Language Definition (`compiler.htf` extension)
- [x] Recursive Evaluation & Isomorphism Resolution
- [x] **7-C "Underground"**: Morphism logic for `Position` dicts (`advance_pos`) and Stream splitting (`read_char`).

## Phase 8: Self-Hosting (The Ouroboros) (Current)
- [ ] Write `01_lexer.topology`: A fully functional Lexer written in TOPOS-Xi.
- [ ] Implement `TokenConstructor` to formalize `LexedToken`.
- [ ] Prove that `Lexer` is a valid Endomorphism on the `LexerState` space.
- [ ] **Challenge**: Implement Tail Call Optimization (TCO) if recursion depth becomes an issue.

## Phase 9: Topological Quantum Computing (Future)
- [ ] Anyon braiding simulation
- [ ] TQFT Axioms
